Unfortunately, because this is merely a repository of repositories, a repository<sup>2</sup> or repositoryception if you will, I am also unable to call this breaking the 4th wall. It is merely a self aware piece of text.\r\n\r\n    \"A masterpiece\" - Nobody\r\n\r\n==================================\r\nI hope you enjoy your time here, because I hope that this page provides something of worth.\r\nI am a self-taught programmer, still self teaching, with a special interest in the syntax and practices of video games programming, but that is still a long way off as I write this. Hopefully some of the projects I post here will be related to that. I hang out on a lot of the tech related subreddits as well, for what its worth.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
