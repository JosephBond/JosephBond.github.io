<p>I could start this by welcoming you, or providing you all with some sort of label but because this is A) not a youtube channel where I scream at you, and B) not a piece of media, you don't care. Unfortunately, because this is merely a repository of repositories, a repository<sup>2</sup> or repositoryception if you will, I am also unable to call this breaking the 4th wall. It is merely a self aware piece of text.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy your time here, because I hope that this page provides something of worth.
I am a self-taught programmer, still self teaching, with a special interest in the syntax and practices of video games programming, but that is still a long way off as I write this. Hopefully some of the projects I post here will be related to that. I hang out on a lot of the tech related subreddits as well, for what its worth.</p>
